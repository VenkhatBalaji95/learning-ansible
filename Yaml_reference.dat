Yaml:

Data collection:
	Data will be stored in a key value pair representation. There are 3 types of data representaion in yaml.

1. Scalar representaion of data:
	Single value will be stored in a single key.
		Syntax --> key: value
		Example --> my_int: 25

Instead of single value for a key, we can use 
	(i) more values for a single key
	(ii) multiple key value pair.
This is called data collection. Tow types are there
	(i) Sequence data collection - It is like storing the list of values. i.e., It is like list in python
			Example:
				name:
				  - venkhat
				  - balaji
				  - age: 25
	(ii) Map data collection - It is like dictionaries in pythone i.e., more than one scalar represenation. We can also add list to the values.
			Example:
				name:
				  my_int: 25
				  name: venkhat balaji
				  age: 25

				    - ILP
